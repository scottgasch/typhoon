    Most of the code in this directory is code that I wrote and has
    the comment "Copyright (C) Scott Gasch" at the start of the file.
    You can do whatever you want with this code except:

        1. Redistribute it; I'd like to be the "official" source for
           code related to this engine.
        2. Sell it; as the copyright holder I expressly forbid you
           from selling the code or any binary it produces.
        3. Claim it is your own; any work based on or inspired by the
           code in question must also contain the copyright notice and
           my name.

    Some of the code under this directory (specifically, the genetic
    programming framework implemented in Java) was written by me but
    is released under the Apache 2.0 license (which is more liberal
    than the restrictions above).

    Some of the code in this directory was written by other people.
    For example, mersenne.c, egtb.cpp and tbdecode.h.  I am using this
    code by permission and do not own the copyright for it.  Please
    contact the code's original author (see comments) for details
    about what can and cannot be done with it.
